MySQL 5.7 is an extremely exciting new version of the world’s most popular open source database that is 2x faster than MySQL 5.6, while also improving usability, manageability, and security. Some key enhancements include:

* Performance & Scalability                                           : Improved InnoDB scalability and temporary table performance, enabling faster online and bulk load operations, and more.
* JSON Support                                                        : Native JSON support (JSON Labs Release).
* Replication improvements for increased availability and performance : They include multi-source replication, multi-threaded slave enhancements, online GTIDs, and enhanced semi-sync replication.
* Performance Schema delivering much better insights                  : We’ve added numerous new monitoring capabilities, reduced the footprint and overhead, and significantly improved ease of use with the new SYS Schema.
* Security                                                            : We are fulfilling “secure by default” requirements and many new MySQL 5.7 features will help users keep their database secure.
* Optimizer                                                           : We have rewritten large parts of the parser, optimizer, and cost model. This has improved maintainability, extendability, and performance.
* GIS                                                                 : Completely new in MySQL 5.7 and including InnoDB spatial indexes, use of Boost.Geometry, along with increased completeness and standard compliance.
