# MySQL Test Framework Manual

<http://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysqltest/en/index.html>

- This document describes the components of the MySQL test framework,
- how the test programs work,
- and the language used for writing test cases.
- It also provides a tutorial for developing test cases
- and executing them.

Within the mysql-test directory, test case input files and result files are stored in the t and r directories, respectively. The input and result files have the same basename, which is the test name, but have extensions of .test and .result, respectively. For example, for a test named “decimal,” the input and result files are mysql-test/t/decimal.test and mysql-test/r/decimal.result.
